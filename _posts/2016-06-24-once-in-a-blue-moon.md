# Once in a Blue Moon

Frequent Flyer

I used to fly a lot and I absolutely loved it, even if the waiting to be boarded might have been tedious and sometimes you had someone strange sitting next to you, I always made sure to book a window seat. It is just the best thing on flight to be able to look out of the window and see the world from above.

Today, I'm not able to fly that often anymore and I miss it.
