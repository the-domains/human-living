# Don't we all long for something?
![And is it fair to pursue it?](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6e38387d-549a-46a7-99b0-c675dfb6f6e5.jpg)

I mostly long for happiness and I know it can be achieved, though just like the little red poppy flowers on the summer fields or the mist in the mountains on a colder morning, it's nothing that is permanent. If you want to experience it, you will have to do something for it, like getting up early.

But what is that something I would have to do to pursue my happiness, and is it always the right thing?

I'll probably never know until it's too late and I might have destroyed the happiness of someone else in the process of finding mine.

Would that be fair?
